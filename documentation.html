                                    The greatest decision you've made so far as a php developer is wanting to use a fast growing tool so let's get started. In the php world, composer is all you need to pull any tool from the php store(Packagist), a place where 95% of the top php project is hosted for remote access via github or any version control system. However, composer can be installed from the official website by visiting <a href="https://getcomposer.org">getcomposer.org</a>, or maybe if you're a big fan of terminal / cmd, swip to it and type in the command below.

You can choose to make other fields redundant by setting them to null by defualt and not also including them in the columns property as fillable field.

        <hr>
        <p class="flow-text">The MVC (model-view-controller) architecture is designed in such a way that different experts can work on one project at the same time without any kind of complications. The view as the name implies is the physical component of any <span class="highlight">App</span> of which users relate with quickly. The view directory where pages are stored is located in the <span class="hightlight">/templates</span> directory.</p>
        <p class="flow-text">There two ways to use view in codefii, one is by using the defualt view from the controller class. example:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="">
<code class="language-php">         
class Test extends Controller {
      public function inex(){
      return $this->view(['Pages/hello','Pages/partial']);
     }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p class="flow-text">Another way to use view is by importing the View class from the <span class="highlight">Core</span> directory</p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="">
<code class="language-php">         
use Core\View\View;
class Test extends Controller{
       public function index(){
        View::render('Pages/index');
       }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p class="flow-text">When using <span class="highlight">View::render();</span> function, your view files likely to be a <span class="highlight">.php</span> file likewise <span class="highlight">$this->view();</span> otherwise it might not work as expected.</p>

<h1 class="section-title">Creating View</h1>
<p class="flow-text">Let's do a more practical example by creating <span class="highlight">base.html</span> in the <span class="hightlight">/templates</span> directory alongside with the following code</p>

<h1 class="section-title">Understanding View Partials</h1>
<p class="flow-text">I know most php programmers are familiar with the use of <span class="highlight">require</span>, ever since the web started growing drastically, the arrangment of files on the web has also change thereby making it easier to manage. These files has been seperated into components for reusability sake. In the codefii, a mere html file is seperated into four parts namely.</p>

 <h1 class="section-title">Partial</h1>
 <p class="flow-text">Partial or partials is the first file read by the server whenever a given url is called. For instance, the <span class="highlight">meta tag</span>, <span class="highlight">link tag</span>, <span class="highlight">title tag</span> and etc. These set of tags are known as the partial tags because they probably remain unchanged on every page, but sometimes only the <span class="highlight">title</span> keeps changing as page changes; so in Codefii they are treated seperately.</p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="">
<code class="language-php">

<h1 class="section-title">Header</h1>
<p class="flow-text">With no much words, the header in this context is reffered to as <span class="highlight">Navigation Menu</span>. Every unique website mentains one navigation menu that's why we choose to call it <span class="highlight">Header</span> in codefii, and it's located in the <span class="highlight">/header</span> directory. Every Header is pre-configured in the <span class="highlight">Codefii/Controllers/Controller.php</span> file for dynamic loading i.e</p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="">

  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<h1 class="section-title">Body</h1>
<p class="flow-text">Well i planned on skipping this part because an average web developershould know that a body means. perherps incase you feel our usage of body is completely different from what you know, it's actually the same. In my case, all my body files are located in <span class="highlight">templates/Pages/</span>. If you feel like doing the same then thumbs up for you, you're not alone i got you in this.</p>

    }
}
</code>
</pre>
<h1 class="section-title">Footer</h1>
<p class="flow-text">Lastly before moving to the next tips, the footer is the same as what you know, but the difference is that it's pre-configured for dynamic usage like the header by the use of <span class="highlight">$this->setFooter()</span> method.</p>

<h1 class="section-title">Sending data to View</h1>
<hr>
<p class="flow-text">
        When using the <span class="hightlight">View::render()</span> or <span class="highlight">$this->view()</span> function, data can be sent to the view inform of an array i.e, let's pass in an hello world text to a view file called <span class="highlight">welcome.php</span> with the following code. The first part of the code goes into the controller, while the second goes into the <span class="highlight">welcome.php</span> file.
</p>

<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="">
<code class="language-php"> 
namespace App\Controllers;
use App\Controllers\Controller;
    class GreetController extends Controller {
        public function index(){
        return $this->view(["Pages/welcome","Pages/partial"
        ['data'=>'Hello World!']);
    }
}

</pre>

<p class="flow-text">Open up <span class="highlight">welcome.php</span> and add the following:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-start=""><code class="language-php">echo $data</code></pre>
<p class="flow-text">When you open up your browser you're expected to see <span class="highlight">Hello World!</span> printed on the screen, that shows that it did worked.</p>
 <h1 class="section-title">Setting Page Title</h1>
 <p class="flow-text">
        Don't forget that every new method you create serve as a page name. The view file sees every data that's send to it so it doesn't matter what text you choose to send to the view, it is where you choose to print out the sent data that matters. Let's create a simple html skeleton with <span class="highlight">title</span>. Create any page of your choose <span class="highlight">.php</span>, but in my case am using <span class="highlight">test.php</span> so add the below code in between the opening and the closing of your <span class="highlight">title tag</span>.
 </p>

 <p class="flow-text">Then after that, go to your controller and add the following code to your method. For the dake of the documentation, i would use <span class="highlight">index</span>.</p>
 <pre class="line-numbers" data-start="">
<code class="language-php"> 
class Test extends Controller {
      public function index(){
      return $this->view(
      ['Pages/welcome','Pages/partial'],
      ['title'=>'Welcome to my first page!']
    );
  }
}      
</code>
</pre>

<p class="flow-text">One you visit <span class="highlight">yourwebsite.com/ or localhost:8080/</span> you would see welcomet to my first page! as your title and a blank screen, that shows your view is working, cheers!</p>
  <h1 class="section-title">Using Twig Template</h1>
  <p class="flow-text">Twig is a template engine written with php by the <span class="highlight">symfony</span> developer team. Template engine in the other hand makes work pretty much easier by optmizing our usual method of organizing files on the web server.</p>

<h1 class="section-title">Namespace</h1>
<p class="flow-text">Namespacing or namespace is a way of defining the location of a php file with class autoloading. For instance, in Codefii, your controller code is location in the <span class="highlight">App/controllers</span>.</p>

<h1 class="section-title">Understanding the Controller</h1>
<p class="flow-text">Action Controller is the <span class="highlight">C</span> in <span class="highlight">MVC</span>. After the router has determined which controller to use for a request, the controller is responsible for making sense of the request, and producing the appropriate output. Luckily, Action Controller does most of the groundwork for you and uses smart conventions to make this as straightforward as possible.</p>
<p class="flow-text">A controller can thus be thought of as a middleman between models and views. It makes the model data available to the view so it can display that data to the user, and it saves or updates user data to the model.</p>
<h1 class="section-title">Controller Naming</h1>
<p class="flow-text">A controller in Codefii is just like the normal class naming in php, but qualifying your class name with <span class="highlight">Controller</span> allows you to use the default class name in route without attaching controller prefix alongside.</p>
<h1 class="section-title">Methods And Actions</h1>
<p class="flow-text">Controllers on Codefii are meant to inhrerit from <span class="highlight">Controller</span> and has method just like any class in php. Methods are executed when the controller recieves a request, then Codefii creates an instance of runs the method called in the route</p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="">
<code class="language-php"> 
use App\controllers\Controller;
class HomeController extends Controller{
       public function firstPage(){
        echo "this is my first page";
     }
}
</code>
</pre>
<p class="flow-text">If a user goes to <span class="highlight">Home/firstPage</span> in your application, Codefii will create and instance of HomeController and call its firstPage method.</p>

<h1 class="section-title">Query String Parameters</h1>
<p class="flow-text">You will probably want to access data sent in by the user or other parameters in your controller through query string parameters which refers to those parameters that are sent as part of the URL. <span class="highlight">https://codefii.com/users?author=prince+darlington</span></p>
<pre class="line-numbers" data-start="">

<h1 class="section-title">Getting Routes Parameter</h1>
<p class="flow-text">Route parameter is a set of rules defined for checking valid URL query string using regular expression. You may have a regex defined as <span class="highlight">{id:([a-zA-z0-9])*}</span> in your routes as:</p>
<p class="flow-text"><span class="highlight">$router->routes('/prince/{id:([a-zA-z0-9])*}')</span></p>

<p class="flow-text">which means that if a user goes to <span class="highlight">/Home/LsldfnfK34</span> (the characters after the last first slahes after prince is an assumed id), while your controller has:</p>
